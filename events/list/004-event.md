At over 3 years old as an open source project, and an Apache project for more than 2 years, Apache Storm is one of the most mature and widely adopted real-time data platforms available. Apache Storm is used across a wide range of industries, from Fortune 500 companies, to three-letter government agencies, to big data startups.

In this session we'll explore how Storm has evolved over the years, and more importantly how it will continue to evolve and innovate in both the near and long term. We will discuss new features, performance improvements, project roadmaps, and it's relationship with other open source streaming solutions.
