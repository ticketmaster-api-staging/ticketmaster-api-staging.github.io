## The Ticketmaster API Devjam in Durham, NC!

This year, Ticketmaster will be rolling out more new technology than ever before!
We're taking the show on the road to meet with you, the developer community, to 
get your feedback on the developer experience we're building and on the new exciting
updates to our APIs!We'll also get to hack on some cool stuff together  From ideas
and solutions around delighting fans in mobile moments to mobile SDKs and tools.

Participants will receive Ticketmaster swag and potentially the 
opportunity to score game or concert tickets (via raffle). More details coming soon.

### API Explorer by EPAM team

Ticketmaster API Explorer application will be presented on Devjam. 
This is very cool open-source application that helps to understand 
API requests and responses instantly, thanks to the EPAM's team and 
such a bright idea introduced for Ticketmaster's API.

### We're also hiring!

Ticketmaster is constantly on the lookout for top talent in the industry. 
We actively recruit through career fairs, student organizations, user groups, 
hackathons and any other method we can think of to locate people that fit 
into our culture. Beginning in the fall we start looking for candidates to 
be a part of our summer internship program. We try to identify these individuals 
by April. As participants in the Devjam that we are sponsoring in January, 
students will have the opportunity to meet and interact with hiring managers 
and teams while they are participating. They will also have the opportunity 
to see what our industry, company and culture is all about.

Looking forward to seeing you guys on February 27, 2016! Happy Coding!

The Ticketmaster Devjam Team
